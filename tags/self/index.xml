from an aged bicycle and an old popsicle.
I am from the brand new muddy house, small, warm, not enough room to live.
I am from the tall green elm tree that I fell out of, but luckily I am still alive.
I’m from the Mah-jongg game at every single new year eve and crafty veterans of it.
From Loong and YuZhou.
I&amp;rsquo;m constantly moving from one place to another and back.</description></item></channel></rss>
