I am from old fashion sewing machine,

I am from the brand new muddy house, small, warm, not enough room to live.

I am from the tall green elm tree that I fell out of, but luckily I am still alive.

I’m from the Mah-jongg game at every single new year eve and crafty veterans of it.

From Loong and YuZhou.

I'm constantly moving from one place to another and back.

From “WAKE-UP! WAKE-UP! WAKE-UP!” and “Don’t fight against your older sister again!”.
 

I’m from the every new year eve’s bonfire for the god of wealth.

I’m from full moon's light in country yard and I’m from QIN and CHANG,

from the frozen pears and persimmons.

From Mom's being an orphan at 16, dad helped himself to go to elementary school.

From the finger end my father lost to the chainsaw while as a carpenter, the roof I jumped from to the ground thousand times for being a Ninja.

I am from these yellowed pages in my deepest mind.
