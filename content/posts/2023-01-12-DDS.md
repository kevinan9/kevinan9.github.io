## OVERVIEW

In order to enable game creators to build rich, large-scale multiplayer experiences where hundreds or even thousands of players can play together in new and dynamic virtual worlds, DDS is designed to be a networking module built for scale built to handle low-latency, high-volume, high-throughput data replication. It runs multiplayer networking as a separate server-side process, scaling to hundreds of millions of interactions a second – enabling thousands of players to join a single virtual world with increased levels of simulated content.

## GOALS

-   Dealing with players’ interactions across multi dedicated servers

## SPECIFICATIONS

1.  Communication between servers

For the server, in order to achieve this technical goal, it is necessary to physically cut the game world, adopt distributed architecture, split the Game World into different map blocks, and hand over to different server processes to carry, and then realize the player transfer between these processes (map cells) through some technical means so that the player does not feel that his data is transferred between these processes Migration process.

2.  Real-Ghost mechanism
    

In order to fit with the later goal, we chose to do the migration on a Real/Ghost basis on this side. The core steps are:

1. trigger the migration process of role A from DS1 to DS2 based on moving boundaries or other behaviors.

2. A on DS1 switches its role to ROLE_ServerSimulatedProxy and sends migration instructions to DS2

3. A on DS1 synchronizes itself to DS2 by means of attribute synchronization, and sets its role on DS2 to ROLE_Authority at the time of synchronization.

4. DS2 determines that the migration is complete and informs DS1, which takes A offline for processing.

5. The client connects to DS2 and continues the behavior.

3.  RPC-based cross-server interactive

As shown above is a traditional interactive process for FPS game developers, our goal is to adapt it to get along with our multi-dedicated server model.
```
float ADistributedDSDemoCharacter::TakeDamage(...)  
{  
if (Health <= 0.f)  
{  
return  0.f;  
}  
const  float ActualDamage = Super::TakeDamage(Damage, DamageEvent, EventInstigator, DamageCauser);  
if (ActualDamage > 0.f)  
{  
/// 关键路径 ///  
Health -= ActualDamage;  
if (Health <= 0)  
...
```
When an RPC call is initiated on the Server side (e.g. DS1), if the target Actor is a Ghost, the RPC is not executed locally, but is sent to DS2 where the Actor (Real) is located.

If the Actor happens to be in the "migrating" state on DS2, the RPC will not be executed locally, but will be sent to DS3, the migration target.

If the Actor is still "non-Real" on DS3, an error is reported!

Similar to "RPC redirection", we also have a concept of RPC propagation, to describe the Server side of the Real Actor received from the client RPC request, if the Real Actor found the existence of Ghost Actor (1 or more), then the local execution of RPC At the same time, the RPC sequence is sent to the DS where all Ghost Actors are located for execution.

The subsequent process is different from "RPC redirection" in that it does not redirect to Real again, because the RPC source is different.
